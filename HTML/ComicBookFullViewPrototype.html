                                <p>Superman is a fictional superhero. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel
                                    and artist Joe Shuster, and first appeared in Action Comics #1, a comic book published 
                                    on April 18, 1938.The character regularly appears in comic books published by DC Comics,
                                    and has been adapted to a number of radio serials, movies, and television shows.</p>
                                <p>Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth. 
                                    As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton 
                                    was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, 
                                    near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan 
                                    and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, 
                                    such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His foster parents advised him to use
                                    his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante. 
                                    To protect his privacy, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" 
                                    when fighting crime. Clark Kent resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where 
                                    he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his 
                                    love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and 
                                    editor-in-chief Perry White. His most well-known villain is Lex Luthor. Superman is part 
                                    of the DC Universe, and as such often appears in stories alongside other DC Universe heroes 
                                    such as Batman and Wonder Woman.</p>
